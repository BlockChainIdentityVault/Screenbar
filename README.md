# Screenbar
An osx menubar app for automating screenshots.    
I'm not sure the world needs another .app for taking screenshots because I didn't bother checking! This is one is made because i wanted a GUI to start and stop automation of screenshots and because i wanted to create it myself.    

When building this app with Xcode you get a new icon in the menubar,next to the clock, that looks like a camera.
